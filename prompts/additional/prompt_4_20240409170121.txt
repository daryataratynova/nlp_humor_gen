Headline: Mixing Covid Vaccines Increases Reports of Mild Side-effects
Lead: Adults are more likely to report mild and moderate side-effects after mixing doses of the AstraZeneca and Pfizer Covid vaccines, a study indicates.
Keywords: Covid Vaccines, Pfizer Covid vaccines
Additional Info: A vaccine is a biological preparation that provides active acquired immunity to a particular infectious or malignant disease.[1][2] The safety and effectiveness of vaccines has been widely studied and verified.[3][4] A vaccine typically contains an agent that resembles a disease-causing microorganism and is often made from weakened or killed forms of the microbe, its toxins, or one of its surface proteins. The agent stimulates the body's immune system to recognize the agent as a threat, destroy it, and recognize further and destroy any of the microorganisms associated with that agent that it may encounter in the future.
