It was the longest men's singles major final (in terms of games played) in history with 77 games, breaking the record of 71 games set at the 1927 Australian Championships. The match also had the longest fifth set (16–14) in a major men's singles final, surpassing the 11–9 fifth set in the 1927 French Championships final.[2] The match took 4 hours and 17 minutes to complete, and the fifth set alone lasted 95 minutes.[3] It was a rematch of the 2004 and 2005 finals, where Federer also beat Roddick to win the title. This was Federer's 11th grass court men's singles title, surpassing the previous Open Era record held by Sampras (10). Notably, Roddick lost despite only having his serve broken once, in the last game of the match. By winning the title, Federer regained the world No. 1 singles ranking.
